                    Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic
                    cheesecake recipe! Paired with a buttery graham cracker
                    crust, no one can deny its simple decadence. For the best
                    results, bake in a water bath.

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li></li>

                    <p>
                        Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and
                        preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).
                    </p>

                    <li></li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Make the crust:</strong> Using a food processor,
                        pulse the graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a
                        medium bowl and stir in sugar and melted butter until
                        combined. (You can also pulse it all together in the
                        food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly
                        into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or
                        10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan first.
                        I use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust
                        down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the
                        oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum
                        foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water
                        bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you
                        prepare the filling.
                    </p>

                    <li></li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Make the filling:</strong> Using a handheld or
                        stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the
                        cream cheese and granulated sugar together on
                        medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is
                        smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream,
                        vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully
                        combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time,
                        beating after each addition until just blended. After
                        the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop
                        mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating
                        and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter
                        as best you can.
                    </p>

                    <li></li>

                    <p>
                        <strong
                            >Prepare the simple water bath (see note)</strong
                        >
                        Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in your
                        roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil
                        enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water. As the
                        water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the
                        springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the
                        crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into
                        an even layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting
                        pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and
                        place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in
                        the oven first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is
                        easier for you.)
                    </p>

                    <li></li>
                    <p>
                        Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is
                        almost set. When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake
                        will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn
                        the oven off and open the oven door slightly. Let the
                        cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools
                        down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath,
                        then cool cheesecake completely at room temperature.
                        Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or
                        overnight.
                    </p>

                    <li></li>
                    <p>
                        Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the
                        rim of the springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a
                        clean sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. For neat
                        slices, wipe the knife clean and dip into warm water
                        between each slice.
                    </p>

                    <li></li>
                    <p>
                        Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store
                        leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5
                        days.
